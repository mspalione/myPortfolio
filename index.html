            Hi, my name is Melissa.
            I am currently a web development student.
            I just completed the front-end web-development course at Code Louisville, 
            an alternative learning program that focuses more on using languages rather than learning theory.
            I will start the C#/.net course in January
            and will highlight new webpages implementing that language as I learn it.
            Check out my projects so far!

        <a href="http://icpconnect.org/" target="_blank"><h3>The Institute for Christian Psychology</h3></a>
        <p class="icptxt">This site is a squarespace site for a non-profit.
            I manage this site in addition to all social media outlets, keeping information up to date, eye-catching and relevant to the audience.
            I have instituted regular blog posts to keep traffic to the site a priority.
            Since taking this role, I have doubled the social media following of the Institute for Christian Psychology and increased traffic flow to the site by 120%.
            I insert custom HTML and CSS as needed, as well as link the site to other platforms like MailChimp.
        </p>

        <p class="mjptxt">This site is a portfolio site for my husband who is a PhD student.
            This site uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as frameworks such as Bootstrap and JQuery.
            I created a custom carousel with next/previous buttons and included dots so the user knows how many images are left to view.
            There are three embedded videos from YouTube, one embedded sound clip from SoundCloud, images, specialized fonts, nav bar, links to outside sites, all made with a mobile-first approach.
            I am hosting the site on GitHub after connecting it with a DNS.

        <a href="https://teloslawncare.wixsite.com/website" target="_blank"><h3>Telos Lawn Care</h3></a>
        <p class="wixtxt">This is a wix site for a lawn-care business.
            I connected the site to google business, added functionality, reviews, and services offered.
            I made the site more professional by using the company name instead of the owner's name for contact information and installed a contact form on multiple pages of the site.
