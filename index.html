    <h1>Melissa Spalione</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Melissa. 
        I am currently a web development student. 
        I just completed the front-end web-development course at Code Louisville, an alternative learning program that focuses more on using languages rather than learning theory.
        I will start the C#/.net course in January and will highlight new programs implementing that language as I learn it.
        Check out my projects so far!
    </p>

        <p>This site is a portfolio site for my husband who is a PhD student.
            This site uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as frameworks such as Bootstrap and JQuery.
            I created a custom carousel with next/previous buttons and included dots so the user knows how many images are left to view.
            There are three embedded videos from YouTube, one embedded sound clip from SoundCloud, images, specialized fonts, nav bar, links to outside sites, all made with a mobile-first approach.
            I am hosting the site on GitHub after connecting it with a DNS.
        </p>

        <p>This site is a squarespace site for a non-profit.
            I manage this site in addition to all social media outlets, keeping information up to date, eye-catching and relevant to the audience.
            I have instituted regular blog posts to keep traffic to the site a priority.
            Since taking this role, I have doubled the social media following of the Institute for Christian Psychology and increased traffic flow to the site by 120%.
            I insert custom HTML and CSS as needed, as well as link the site to other platforms like MailChimp.

        </p>
