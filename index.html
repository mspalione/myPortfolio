            <h1>Hi, my name is Melissa Spalione.</h1>
            <p>I am currently a jr web developer working for a small consulting company. See my resume <a href="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/melissadevportfolio.com/KathrynMelissaSpalioneResume+(1).pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <p>I spend my time split between developing in C#, creating CRMs for clients using Podio, and functioning as a Project Manager over the Podio builds.</p>
            <p>I completed the front-end web-development and C# courses at Code Louisville, a local bootcamp.</p>
            <p>This page highlights a few projects that I have done.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I can't have any C# work samples here, as there is client-sensitive material in them. 
               In summary of my work, I write C# Lambda functions to interact with Podio installations via API through AWS. 
               Incidentally, this portfolio is also hosted on AWS using bucket storage.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>GitHub Links to Work Samples</h2>
            <p>I primarily utilize my GitHub to practice concepts I'm learning, so there are a lot of unfinished projects on there. Below are some links to relative GitHub repos.</p> 
            <p><a href="https://github.com/mspalione/BeginToCodeWithCSharp" target="_blank">Here</a>
                is one C# project I did recently practicing digging down into a dictionary and adding a new method to be used in a program. Something I have had no training in.
               <a href="https://github.com/mspalione/BeginToCodeWithCSharp/blob/master/Snaps/Snaps/XAMLSnaps/Behaviours/StringStorage.cs" target="_blank">Here</a>
                is where you can see the Behaviours dictionary. I added the EditStringToLocalStorage method to the StringStorage dictionary.
               <a href="https://github.com/mspalione/BeginToCodeWithCSharp/blob/master/Snaps/Snaps/SnapsEngine.cs" target="_blank">Here</a>
                is where you can see the dictionary to call all methods where I added the call to the EditStringToLocalStorage method. And 
               <a href="https://github.com/mspalione/BeginToCodeWithCSharp/blob/master/BeginToCodeWithCSharp/Chapters/Chapter%2008/Ch08_08_TinyContactBookLocalStore.cs" target="_blank">here</a>
                is where you can see where I implemented the method to edit a previously saved contact onto a computer's local storage.</p>
            <br>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/mspalione/UnivSearch" target="_blank">Here</a>
                is my first MVC project in C#. I learned MVC in a weekend to complete an on time project for a quick deadline having previously never used MVC.
                This project utilized csv to Json for data and JavaScript to create a sortable and searchable table.</p>
            <br>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/mspalione/spal_gal" target="_blank">Here</a>
                is a starter religious public speaking portfolio site I created for myself, utilizing some fun JavaScript maneuvering.</p>

        <a href="http://icpconnect.org/" target="_blank"><h3>The Institute for Christian Psychology</h3></a>
        <p class="icptxt">This site is a squarespace site for a local non-profit.
            I previously managed this site in addition to all social media outlets, keeping information up to date, eye-catching and relevant to the audience.
            I instituted regular blog posts to keep traffic to the site a priority.
            In the time that I worked for the Institute for Christian Psychology, I doubled the social media following and increased traffic flow to the site by 120%.
            I insert custom HTML and CSS as needed, as well as link the site to other platforms like MailChimp.
            Working on this site was a great tool in site-design and learning what works to keep the consumer coming.

        <p class="mjptxt">This site is a portfolio site for my husband who is a PhD student.
            This site uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as frameworks such as Bootstrap and JQuery.
            I created a custom carousel using JavaScript with next/previous buttons and included dots so the user knows how many images are left to view.
            There are three embedded videos from YouTube, three embedded sound clip from SoundCloud, images, specialized fonts, nav bar, links to outside sites, all made with a mobile-first approach.
            I am hosting the site on GitHub Pages after connecting it with a DNS.

        <p class="wixtxt">This is a wix site for a lawn-care business.
            I connected the site to google business, added functionality, reviews, and services offered.
            I made the site more professional by using the company name instead of the owner's name for contact information and installed a contact form on multiple pages of the site.
